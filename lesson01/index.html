      I have been studying web development on and off for about 2-3 years now. I
      started learning on youtube around 2021, post pandemic, and found it not
      as intimidating that i had originally thought. After getting mentored by
      my cousin and brother (both working professional web devs), I decided to
      go back to school and pursue this degree. It's been quite the journey, but
      we're still here.

      Living and studying in the beautiful city of San Diego has many perks.
      I've met many incredible people and have found my love of crafts and music
      taken to new heights. You can almost always catch me supporting an artist
      or two whenever I can. If i cant be found a venue during my free time, Im
      most likely at home working on a project I haven't touched in months,
      learning a brand new craft, or creating silly songs with my roommates.
      Maybe one day we'll share them online, but not quite there yet!
